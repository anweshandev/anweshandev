You may have guessed that I enjoy coding. My major areas of interest include frontend development (React.js/Flutter) artificial intelligence/machine learning & backend developement. Other field of interest include UI/UX development, Full Stack development, DevOps etc.

My goto stack would be Firebase on Google Cloud, with React.js (Vite + SWC), and TailwindCSS. But if I want something fast, I often fallback to [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

Professionally I am included in multiple projects. But my most recent project would be a custom application which creates storybooks using AI. The concept is called [Bookaible](https://bookaible.ai).

Aside from programming, I enjoy playing my synthesizer, listening to music, binge-watching fascinating shows, and eating a lot of excellent (or perhaps amazing) food (very often, without a reason).
