# Hi 👋🏻,

I am Anweshan Roy Chowdhury (@cybrix) a 23 years old Computer Science geek. Currently I work as a Full Stack Developer (Full-Time) at [Pravaah Consulting Inc](https://pravaahconsulting.com), while pursuing my Master of Science Degree in Computer Science & Engineering from the University of Calcutta. I finished my Bachelor of Science (Honors) Degree in Computer Science from the same university in 2021 with a CGPA of A.

You may have guessed that I enjoy coding. My major areas of interest include artificial intelligence/machine learning & backend developement. Other field of interest include UI/UX development, Full Stack development, DevOps etc.

My primary go-to database is any oneof a NoSQL flavour. The horizontal scalabilty amuses me everytime I use them. I primarily use Cloud Firestore by Firebase. However MongoDB on Docker is always a preference. My favourite full stack library is React.js. A framework on a similar note is Next.js. The coolest UI library of my choice is TailwindCSS, but if I am building something quickly, I often fallback to Bootstrap.

My recent contribution both professionally & personally would be a backend API written in Express.js which utilized the power of Firebase Admin SDK to authenticate (with credentials & Google/Facebook/Twitter), storing/reading/modifying/deleting data from Cloud firestore & Cloud storage, using Razorpay SDK (India)/ Stripe SDK / PayPal SDK to checkout, all for a mobile application built natively on iOS and Android. My contributions in Android version were limited but present, while being a noob on SwiftUI (iOS) 😥. Well on the plus side, I know Flutter 😀.

Aside from programming, I enjoy playing my synthesizer, listening to music, binge-watching fascinating shows, and eating a lot of excellent (or perhaps amazing) food (very often, without a reason).
